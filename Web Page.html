    <h2> The Web </h2>
   </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>  The web is made of HTML pages called hypertext markup language. This is the <span class="italics">basis for almost all webpages</span> and the links which connect these pages are called <span class="bold">hyperlinks</span>.</p>

     <h2>Major pieces of the web</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p> 
       The major pieces of the web are <br> <br> The Browser : Makes requests to the internet <br> The internet : Uses HTTP whch is the <span class="italics">main protocol</span> of the web to communicate with the browser and the server <br> The Server : These are computers which host web files.
     </p>
     <p>
      HTML is the<span class="italics"> heart of the web</span> which is made up of text content, markup, reference to other documents and links to other pages.  
     </p>
     <p>
      HTML markups are used to change a particular text into some form(for example : BOLD or Italics). These markups mainly use tags for this purpose.
     </p>

   <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">
    <h2> Tags </h2>
    </div>
     <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
      Tags are used in HTML markups to perform a particular set of functions such as to change a particular text into bold or Italicized text, to refer to other documets such as to include images, to include links to other pages.<br><br> Tags consist of an <span class="italics">opening tag, the contents and a closing tag</span>. All these three together is called an element.<br><br> HTML Attributes are also used along with tags. These Attributes have a name and a value which are used to provide links to other pages in HTML.<br> For example, Anchor tags have href as their attribute. Also, a tag can have multiple attributes.
     </p>

    <h2> Inline and Block </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
      Tags like the p tag and the br tag can be classified into Inline and Block. As we can see, both the tags work in a similar fashion. But, they do have a significant difference between them. The br tag just breaks the line whereas the p tag creates an <span class="italics">invisible box</span> around the content where it is used. Also, the br tag is a void tag and does not have a closing tag.<br> <br> Some of the other tags that were introduces were span and div tags which are inline and block tags respectively.

   <h2> Introduction</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p> HTML pages are <span class="bold">building blocks</span> of a web page. It is analogous to <span class="italics">constructing a house</span>.<br> They form the structures of the house as to which should be the living room and which room should be the bed room. <br> <br> The CSS are for styling like what colour should be the walls etc.

     <h2>Tree like structures</h2>
     </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p> 
      The HTML pages are made of<span class="italics"> branches</span> of structures.<br> Analysing structures and styling in a given web page is done using the <span class="bold">"Developer tools"</span> in the web. Other elements can exist inside of the HTML elements and this can be compared to a family tree.
     </p>
     <p>
      This structure, in a browser is shown as a series of nested boxes which contains elements within elements.
     </p>

    <h2> Indented HTML and Boxes </h2>
   </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
       A HTML document is deeply indented and can be seen as a wave on the left side of the document. When there is a lot of indentations seen it means that those many elements are nested in the document.

    <h2> Programming in Text Editors </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
   <p>
     Text Editors such as Sublime Text and Codepen.io is used by programmers to write their code. This makes it easier for them to used tags. Some text editors use the ending tag <span class="italics">automatically </span>when a tag is introduced in the code.
   </p>
  </div>

 <div class="concept">  
  <div class="concept-title">
   <h2> HTML, CSS and DOM </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      The HTML is a language used to write the web page which has a syntax and there are some rules associated as to how to write text on the web. <br> CSS is used for styling and it determies how the web page looks. <br> Document object model abbreviated as DOM is for communicating within elements. Tags are helpful in turning elements in trees.

     <h2>Avoiding Repetition and Errors</h2>
   </div>
   <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      Copying and pasting some attributes of styling in HTML elements and rewriting the same code may lead to <span class="italics">unnecessary repetition</span> of code writing.It also causes errors while programming and hence has to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      While designing a web page, the HTML can be written as a structure within divs and<span class="italics"> classes</span> can be assigned to each of these divs. The styling can be applied by mentioning only the class name in the CSS file. This helps the programmers to avoid repetition of codes.

     <h2> CSS</h2>
   </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
       Cascading styling sheets is shortly referred to as CSS. As the name suggests, in CSS, the styling is appied to the document in an inherited styling method where the style assigned for a parent content is inherited by the tag that encloses the content. 
     </p>
     <p>
       This is done by giving a class name to each div in the HTML document.
